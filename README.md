# Digital_Binocular_Eyepiece


The Digital Binocular Eyepiece is a 3D printed construction, containing a small LCD display and two eyepieces, meant to be mounted on a telescope and show digital images of the sky. It has around 40Â° AFOV (apparent field of view), and around 1250x1250 pixels per eye. 
It is meant as a part of EAA (Electronic Assisted Astronomy) rig and shows a digital image captured with telescope during EAA session. Looking in this binocular display is much more immersive, comparing to looking on a simple display. Image is placed optically on infinity, and one gets the feeling of depth and space, looking onto it with both eyes. It is resembling looking into the optical telescope, but one can see much more, than purely opticaly, especially under light polluted sky.
